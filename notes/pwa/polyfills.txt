promise and fetch apis are supported by most browsers now but it does not work in the old browsers, 
 to make that work 2 files need to be included in the project(prmoise.js and fetcf.js)

include these 2 files in all the html files or index.html(in angular)
we need to include them before any other js files we include
first promise.js file is included and then the fetch.js as fetch also uses promise

in app.js include the following code:
   if(!window.Promise){                    //check if promise is supported by browser or not
      window.Promise = Promise;            // if not then set it to Promise(defined in polyfills file included)
   }
