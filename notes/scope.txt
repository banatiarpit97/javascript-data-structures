var name = "arpit";          //global variable

function example(){
    var name = "arpit";         //local variable

    number = 9999999999;        //global variable(As not declared with var keyword)
}

1. If name of global and local variables are same, preference will be given to local variable

2. Global variable should be used very carefully, global variables can be accessed by other scripts
   included in the page(user defined or libraries) and hence can cause problems.

3. Global variables are properties of window object, we can use them using var_name or window.var_name

4. let and const are block scoped(and are not hoisted)

5. declaring multiple varibales in a line, 
        var a = "red", b = 1, c;

6. redeclaring variable does not alter its value or cause an error
    var a = "red"
    var a;
    a //still red

7. Variable declarations are hoisted but not assignments or definations.
    food    //undefined(no error because of hoisting)
    var food = "apple";
    food    //apple
