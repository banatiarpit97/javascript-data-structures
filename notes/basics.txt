JIT - just in time compiler.It defers the compilation.
        if it encounters a function definition, it will not compile the function right away.
        it just stores function in memory.
        function will be compiled when it is called the first time.

Javascript compiler takes 2 passes to run the source code.
in first pass, it does things as declaration, hoisting of var, function etc...
and in seconds pass, it executes each line like an interpreter and does work like initialization, execution.
The difference from other interpreted languages is that,
in second pass js already knows what will come in next line or after that.

var a = "Arpit" is treated as 2 lines while compilation.
Firstly declaration(registering of variables) takes place and after that 
initialization.

Actually hoisting does not happen, its just a concept to understand 2 passes
of compiler.In first pass, all vars are registered and that is what when
call hoisting
