frontend can only make api request to backend hosted on same origin by default.
Same origin means same protocol(http and https are diff), 
origin(subdomains are diff), and port.

If we want to make request to another origin, server needs to set some headers to
allow frontend to do so.
Before making api calls(not every api call), frontend makes an options request to
the server and server in response, set some headers like 
Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Methods which will allow the
foll requests to be completed.
