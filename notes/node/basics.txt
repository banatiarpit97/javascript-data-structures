in node window becomes global
document becomes process

non-blocking I/O - asynchronus operations

the file we require executes the moment we include it in our file.

'module' is an object that is available by default in node.
module has a property 'exports' which is also an object.
Whatever is present in module.exports can be accessed by any file that requires it.

npm init - makes package.json for our project

When we require a module, node first checks if there is core module(like fs, http) by that name,
if not found then it checks in the 'node_modules' folder
If we want to require our local files, we can't just give name of file even if it is same directory
we need to give a relative path like './notes'

passing command line args:
node file_name arg1 arg2 ...        //separated by space

process.argv -> array of command line arguements starting from 3rd elem
1st elem is path of node
2nd elem is name of the file
