Node.js global objects are global in nature and available in all modules. 
You don't need to include these objects in your application; rather they can 
be used directly. These objects are modules, functions, strings and object etc. 
Some of these objects aren't actually in the global scope but in the module scope.

A list of Node.js global objects are given below:

__dirname
__filename
Console
Process
Buffer
setImmediate(callback[, arg][, ...])
setInterval(callback, delay[, arg][, ...])
setTimeout(callback, delay[, arg][, ...])
clearImmediate(immediateObject)
clearInterval(intervalObject)
clearTimeout(timeoutObject)
