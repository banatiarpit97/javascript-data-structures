Payload comes to the server in streams.
Streams does not send all the data at once, data comes in chunks, so we need to collect
these chunks as they arrive and combine them into one.
To know that a chunk of data has arrived to listen to an event 'data' on the request

const StringDecoder = require('string_decoder').StringDecoder;
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    if(req.url === '/' && req.method === 'GET'){
        const decoder = new StringDecoder('utf-8');
        let buffer = '';
        req.on('data', function(data) {
            buffer += decoder.write(data);
        })

        req.on('end', function() {
            buffer =+ decoder.end();
            console.log('Payload is', buffer);

            res.end('Hello')
        })
    }
})

server.listen(8081, function() {
    console.log('listening on port 8081');
});
