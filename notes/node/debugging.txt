to start debugger :
node inspect file_name
nodemon inspect file_name

the debugger will stop just before executing the first line
type 'n' -> to execute next line and stop again
type 'c' -> to execute statements till 'debugger' or till the end.
type 'repl' -> to go into testing mode, after repl, type name of any variable in console to 
                get its value at that particular time.
                ctrl-c to get out of repl(back to debugger)
type 'ctrl-c' to get out of debugger

use 'debugger' in code anywhere to stop the execution when 'c' is typed.


To debug from code :

node --inspect-brk file_name
open chrome://inspect
open 'Open dedicated DevTools for Node'

click on any line to add debugger statement before it
click on green arrow, which will work as 'c'
type name of any variable in console to get its current value
