we can provide middlewares in the api call.
These middlewares are normal functions that will run before we run our api logic.
We need to call next() on these middlewares so that either next middleware or our api logic
is invoked.

Running a middleware after our api logic:
    const middleware = function (req, res, next) {
        await next();
        console.log('will run after api logic');
    }
