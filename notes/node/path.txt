The Node.js path module is used to handle and transform files paths.
    var path =  require ("path")  


path.normalize(p)	
    It is used to normalize a string path, taking care of '..' and '.' parts.

path.join([path1][, path2][, ...])	
    It is used to join all arguments together and normalize the resulting path.

path.resolve([from ...], to)	
    It is used to resolve an absolute path.

path.isabsolute(path)	
    It determines whether path is an absolute path. an absolute path will 
    always resolve to the same location, regardless of the working directory.

path.relative(from, to)	
    It is used to solve the relative path from "from" to "to".

path.dirname(p)	
    It return the directory name of a path. It is similar to the unix dirname command

path.basename(p[, ext])	
    It returns the last portion of a path. It is similar to the Unix basename command.

path.extname(p)	
    It returns the extension of the path, from the last '.' to end of string 
    in the last portion of the path. if there is no '.' in the last portion of 
    the path or the first character of it is '.', then it returns an empty string.

path.parse(pathstring)	
    It returns an object from a path string.

path.format(pathobject)	
    It returns a path string from an object, the opposite of path.parse above.
