WebSockets are an alternative to HTTP communication in Web Applications.

They offer a long lived, bidirectional communication channel between client and server.

Once established, the channel is kept open, offering a very fast connection with low 
latency and overhead.
WebSockets are great for real-time and long-lived communications.



How WebSockets differ from HTTP:
HTTP is a very different protocol, and has a different way of communicating.
the server can send a message to the client without the client explicitly requesting something
the client and the server can talk to each other simultaneously
very little data overhead needs to be exchanged to send messages. 
This means a low latency communication.

Secured WebSockets
Always use the secure, encrypted protocol for WebSockets, wss://.

ws:// refers to the unsafe WebSockets version (the http:// of WebSockets), 
and should be avoided for obvious reasons.
