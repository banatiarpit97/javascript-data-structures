There are two kinds of comments:

Single-line comments via // extend to the rest of the line. Hereâ€™s an example:
    var a = 0; // init

Multiline comments via /* */ can extend over arbitrary ranges of text. They cannot be nested. 

    /* temporarily disabled
    processNext(queue);
    */

    function (a /* int */, b /* str */) {
    }
