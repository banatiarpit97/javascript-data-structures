There is an '_id' field in every document inserted by mongo by default.
The is unique for every document.

The id(12 bytes) is made up of :
    timestamp - first 4 bytes
    machine id - 3 bytes
    process id - 2 bytes
    counter - 3 bytes

to get timestamp from id - id.getTimestamp();
this means that we don't need to store the time at which the document was inserted

If we want to specify our own '_id', we can give that in the object while inserting it.

Extracting ObjectId from mongodb :
    const ObjectID = require('mongodb').ObjectID;
    var id = new ObjectID() //will give a unique id

if we need to find a document by id, we just can put that as a string
because id is stored as onject in collections

db.collections('coll_name').find({_id:"6tc6d76t374r"})                //will not work
db.collections('coll_name').find({_id:new ObjectID("6tc6d76t374r")})       //will work

convert string to Object -> new ObjectID("6tc6d76t374r")
convert Object to string -> new ObjectID("6tc6d76t374r").toHexString();

to check if id is valid or not:
ObjectID.isValid(id);           //return true if valid otherwise false
//id param is string not object
