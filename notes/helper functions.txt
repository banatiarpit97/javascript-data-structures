.substsr(start_index, length) -> will return string from start_index to number of characters in length
				does not alter original string
				if start_index is negative, then it will start from back but will still go in forward direction

.slice(start_index, end_index) -> will return a subarray, staring from start_till end_index(not including it)
					does not alter original array
				
				a= [1,2,3]
				a.splice() returns COPY of a(not reference)
				a.splice(0,2) returns [1,2] (a is till ([1,2,3])
 
.splice(start_index, length, item1, item2,....)  -> will insert item1, itemm2... at the start_index,
							if length is not zero then first it will delete that many elements starting from start_index and then add all specified elements
							if only start_index and length is given, then it will return an array of elements starting from start_index till length

						if lenngth is 0, then splice used only for insertinf elements
						if only start_index and length is present and no extra items, then splice is used for deletion only
						if length is not 0 and extra elements are also present, then splice is used for replacement of elements(delete then insert)

						return an array of deleted elements
						original array is changed

.reverse() -> reverses array or string[will alter original array but not original string(strings are immutable)]

.sort((a,b) => {return a-b}) -> will sort array,	
				2 elements 'a' and 'b' will be compared, 
				if condition in return statement is greater than 0 then it will swap those elements
				not stable
				Must return a number(negative, 0, positive, returning true/false won't work so no return a>b)

Array.from(arr_name, (a) => {return a*a}) -> will create another array from existing array, 2nd param is optional and is used if along copying, we have to make certain changes to array elements also
						does not change original array

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
.filter((a) => {return a>5}) -> will create another array from existing array but will copy only those elements 
				to new array that satisfy the condition in return statement(in this case, elements that are greater than 5)
				does not change original array
				new array can only contain the elements present in original array i.e. we can only copy
				elements, we can not manipulate and then copy.

.map((a) => {return a>5}) -> has 2 functions.
				1. (if a condition is presnt in return statement)
					like filter but instead of creating new array with the values that passed the test, 
					it places true in the new array and false for the values that does not pass the test
				2. When a computational statement is present in return
					original elements are first modified according to the computational statement and
					then copied to new array.
				does not change original array

				var a = [1,2,3];
				var b = a.map((a) => {
					return a>1;
				})					//b will be [false, true, true]

				var b = a.map((a) => {
					return a*2;			
				})					//b will be [2,4,6]

.find((a) => {return a>5})	will return first item that is found to satisfy the condition
				works like filter but returns an element and not array

.findIndex((a) => {return a>5})	works like find but returns index and not element
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
.forEach((e) => {sum += a}) -> perform operation on every element of array
				can not change original array as it only provides value of element in paramater, we can not manupilate the element, we can use its value

.indexOf(elem) -> will return index of element(first ocuurence) in array or string if it is present else return -1
			a second optional parameter can also be passed which specifies index from where to start the search(by default is 0)
				if negative then search starts from (array.length + second_param)   (use -1 to start from end)

.lastIndexOf(elem) -> will return index of element(last ocuurence) in array or string if it is present else return -1
			a second optional parameter can also be passed which specifies index from where to start the search(by default is -1)
				even if negative still searches from back to front where back is (array.length + second_param) and front is 0

encodeURIComponent(string) -> converts string to URL(like replacing space with %20 etc)
decodeURIComponent(url) -> converts URL to string(like replacing %20 with space etc)

if we dont pass any param to .join(), then its default is ','
