static methods and properties in a class have only 1 copy of them for all the objects
these methods and props are called directly from class and not from ay object of that class

static method:

class maths{
    constructor(){

    }
    static add(a, b){
        return a+b;
    }
}
maths.add(1,3);
we can not access this variable inside static methods.


static property:

class maths{
    constructor(){
        this.a = 2;
    }
}
maths.numner1 = 2;      //defined  outside the class and wothout 'this' keyword unlike normal
                        properties of the class
