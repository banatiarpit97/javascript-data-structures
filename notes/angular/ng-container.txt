Logical container used to group nodes but  rendered in DOM tree but is rendered as 
comment
Helps us avoid wrapping content in extra div
Angular does not allow to use more than 1 structural directive on an html
element, hence we can use <ng-container> and put 1 structural directive in it

Difference with ng-template:
ng-container is always rendered whereas ng-template is only rendered when a structural 
directive requests it
Structural directives in ng-container can be used as usual like we do in normal
html elements

    <ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet="template; context:obj">

    </ng-container>

    <ng-template #template let-ob="data">
        <h1>hello {{ob}}</h1>
    </ng-template>
