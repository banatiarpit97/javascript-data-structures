Angular 4.3+ used HttpClient instead Http because of following advantages:
ability to listen to progress events
ability to use interceptors to modify request and response
include observable apis
include error handling
include response object
include typed requests
include testability feature
supports json by default, no need to parse

HttpClient is an injectable class

    import {HttpClientModule} from '@angular/common/http';
    and put it in imports secion of @NgModule
this must be imported after BrowserModule

In service/component:

    import {HttpClient} from '@angular/common/http';

    constructor(private http:HttpClient){

    }

Methods in HttpClient:
get post put delete head jsonp options patch requests
