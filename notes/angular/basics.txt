e2e folder - for end to end testiing(intergration testiong)
karma, jasmine - used for testing in angular
.spec.ts - unit testing of component

pachage.json - dependencies object contains key, values of dependencies required in production mode
            devDependencies contains key, values of dependencies required in development mode only

package.lock.json - (locks the version)contains information about exact version of dependencies installed in our sysytem
package.json can contain approximate value of these versions(using ~, ^) but not package.lock.json
^ - looks for equal or higher version of 2nd and 3rd decimal place(from left)
~ - looks for equal or higher version of 3rd decimal place(from left)

Angular uses AOT(ahead of compilation) i.e. it compiles js at terminal and sends the compiled version of js to browser which lowers the
scripting time as now browser does not have to compile js
Web browser generally uses JIT(just in time compilation) i.e. compile js when it arrives which takes more time as compared to AOT
