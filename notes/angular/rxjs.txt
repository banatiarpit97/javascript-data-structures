RxJS is JavaScript library for transforming, composing and querying asynchronous streams of data.
RxJS can be used both in the browser or in the server-side using Node.js.

If we use angular cli to create angular app, then RxJS is installed by default
if not use, npm install rxjs -S

Reactive programming is a programming paradigm for writing code, 
mainly concerned with asynchronous data streams.
Just a different way of building software applications which will “react” to changes 
that happen instead of the typical way of writing software where we explicitly 
write code (aka “imperative” programming) to handle those changes.

types of async operations:
DOM events - mouse, keyboard, touch, form
Animations
ajax
sockets...

Observables provide support for passing messages between publishers and subscribers in your application.
Observable can be subscribed using subscribe or async pipe
Observable is a class of RxJS
  import {Observable} from 'rxjs/Observable';

  Subscribe:
    this.http.get(url).subscribe(books => console.log(books))

  async pipe with ngFor:
    this.books = this.http.get(url);

    <li *ngFor="let book of books|async">
      {{book.name}}
    </li>

  async pipe with ngIf:
    this.favBook = this.http.get(url);

    <li *ngIf="favBook | async as book;else loading">
      {{book.name}}
    </li>
    <ng-template #loading>
      img src="loader.gif>
    </ng-template>

    //async automatically subscribes to observable and return last emitted value

const button = document.querySelector("button");
    const observer = {          //error and complete are optional
      next: function(value) {
        console.log(value);
      },
      error: function(err) {
        console.error(err);
      },
      complete: function() {
        console.log("Completed");
      }
    };

    const observable = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(button, "click");
    observable.subscribe(observer);

OPERATORS :
Operators are functions that build on the Observables foundation to enable 
sophisticated manipulation of collections.

An Operator is essentially a pure function which takes one Observable as input 
and generates another Observable as output.

Operators pass each value from one operator to the next before proceeding to the next
value in the set. This is different from array operators (map and filter) which will 
process the entire array at each step.

types:
Creation - from, fromPromise, fromEvent, of
Combination - combineLatest, concat, merge, startWith, withLatestFrom, zip
Filtering - debounceTime, distinctUntilChange, filter, take, takeUntil
Transformation - bufferTime, concatMap, map, mergeMap, scan, switchMap
Utility - tap
Multicasting - share

RxJS Subject is a special type of Observable that allows values to be multicasted to many Observers.
While plain Observables are unicast (each subscribed Observer owns an independent execution
of the Observable), Subjects are multicast.
A subject in RxJS is a special hybrid that can act as both an Observable 
and an Observer at the same time.

    const subject = new Rx.Subject();

    subject.subscribe({
        next: v => console.log("observerA: " + v)
        });
        subject.subscribe({
        next: v => console.log("observerB: " + v)
    });

    subject.next(1);
    subject.next(2);

    // output
        // observerA: 1
        // observerB: 1
        // observerA: 2
        // observerB: 2
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Map operator:
transforms one value to another
takes a value from observable stream, apply some Transformation on it and returns
another observable stream

  import {'rxjs/add/operator/map'};
  this.http.get(/api/books')
    .map(book => book.name)   //return modified observable stream
    .subscribe(name => console.log(name))
