Array.prototype.includes()
This feature introduces a more readable syntax for checking if an array contains 
an element.

With ES6 and lower, to check if an array contained an element you had to use 
indexOf, which checks the index in the array, and returns -1 if the element is 
not there.
Since -1 is evaluated as a true value, you could not do for example

    if (![1,2].indexOf(3)) {
        console.log('Not found')
    }

With this feature introduced in ES7 we can do
    if (![1,2].includes(3)) {
        console.log('Not found')
    }

Exponentiation Operator
The exponentiation operator ** is the equivalent of Math.pow(), but brought 
into the language instead of being a library function.
    Math.pow(4, 2) == 4 ** 2
