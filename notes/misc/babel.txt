config is set in .babelrc(JSON FILE)

Config is an object and looks like:
    {
        "presets": ["@babel/preset-react", "@babel/preset-env"],
        "plugins": ["@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties"],
    }

presets are actually a set of plugins already configured and wrapped for use
plugins are additional features we want to add in our app, any experimental features are put
in plugins

@babel/preset-env will check our env in package.json under browserslist array and create our bundle 
for that environment
