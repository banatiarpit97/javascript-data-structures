setup:
    npm install eslint -g

in the project directory:
    eslint --init
    answer the questions asked by the setup and a config file named
    .eslintrc will be created that contains all the rules defined by us
    plus it extends the basic eslint rules at the end

about eslint config:
    'rules' is an object that contain key as name of the rule(like 'indent')
    and value of each key is an array.first item of the array is a number 
    (0-ignore, 1-warning, 2-error) and second items denotes the actual value of rule
    ('tabs', 'spaces' for indent)

    after rules there is an 'env' object that that tells about the envirnment our app
    will run like es6: true, node: false, browser: true...

    after env, there is a property called 'extends' and its value is "eslint:recommended"

to check files for linting:
    eslint {filename}
    or add in npm scripts: "lint": eslint **.js and use the command npm run lint

setup for react:
    answer 'react' in frameworks after running eslint --init and yes to jsx

    in config file:
        "esmaFeatures":{jsx: true} will be added
        plugins: ['react'] will be added

        'eslint-plugin-react' is automatically installed in npm dev dependencies

        add a rule:
            check the plugin docs to see the rule name
            add it to rules section like:
                'react/prop-types': 1
