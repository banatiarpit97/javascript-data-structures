we can compress our bundle using gzip so that the size of the resource is minimized and hence fetched earlier
from the server.

Dynamic Compression:
    occures on the fly. User makes request, content is compressed and server to user.

Static Compression
    Assets are compressed ahead of request on the disk, pre compressed assets are served on request

Problem with Dynamic Compression is that server can not reply to user until it has compressed the file
hence Dynamic Compression requires more time to return the asset
