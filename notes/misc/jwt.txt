When we login, we receive 2 tokens i.e. Access token and Refresh token.

Refresh token
    set in the cookie from backend and hence sent automatically with every request.
    also stored in DB.
    has longer validity or sometimes infinite validity

Access token
    stored in frontend local storage and sent to backend with every request in the headers section
    has shorted validity

When access token is expired and the backend returns response 'Unauthorized', we hit an api in which
reads refresh token from the cookie, validates it, matches it with db and then create and return a new
access token.
