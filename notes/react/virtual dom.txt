Every time DOM changes, browser has to do 2 intensive operations:
    Reflow - recalculate the layout of a portion of page or whole page
    Repaint - content changes to an element that does not affect layout/positioning
    relative to other elements

React uses virtual DOM to help browser use less resources when changes need to
be done on page

When we change state using setState, react marks the component dirty
Then react updates virtual dom of dirty components, runs the diffing algo to make changes

This algo is fast because react batches much of the changes, all elements that
need to be changed at the same time and hence changes are rendered just once.
reflow and repaint are expensive that's why updates are batched.

React uses unidirectional data flow, from parent to child only

Reconcillation - VDOM is a virtaul representation of a UI kept in memory and is synced
with the real DOM by a library ReactDOM.
