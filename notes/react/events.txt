while adding events to components, we need to make sure that we don't call
the attached function, we just need to pass it like we do in callbacks

    <Header onClick = { handleClick } />
        //this sends event arguement automatically to attached function
    <Header onClick = { handleClick() } />  //is wrong, 
        //'handleClick' will be called as soon as Header renders

To pass arguements:
    <Header onClick = { () => handleClick(name, class) } />

in order to solve cross browser issues, event handlers in react are passed an instance of
Synthetic event, which is a wrapper around browser's native event, Synthetic events have same
interface as native ones but it works same in all browsers.

React does not attach event listeners to child node, instead it listens to all the
events at top level using single event listener. This is performance boost.
This is event delegation
