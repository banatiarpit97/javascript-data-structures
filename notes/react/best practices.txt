avoid putting conditionals in render function of component, instead create a separate
function that has conditional statements in it and return the required jsx and call this
function from 'render'

    renderContent(){
        if(){
            return ...
        }
        else if(){
            return ...
        }
    }

    render(){
        return (
            return <div>{this.renderContent()}</div>
        );
    }

if we want force to re-render a component and that component is getting its data from an array 
or object, we don't need to change or add properties of that object, instead we can just clone
that object into a new one using spread operator like a={...b}.

Since react/redux checks refernce of an array/object to detect changes and re-render a component,
we can re-render a component without changing its properties
