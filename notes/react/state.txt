it is an object
contains data that is local to the component and might change frequently
whenever state changes, component is re rendered i.e. render method of component
is called
can only be defined in class based component
Changing state of components can only affect itself and its children but not 
sibling or parents
Child can also mutate state of parent(indirectly) by passing a function down as prop

initialize state:
in constructor of class or outside it
    this state = {name: 'arpit', gender: 'male'};

updating state:
we can not directly change the state object(wont give error but component will not re render)
instead we use function setState()
    this.setState({name: 'banati'});

    this.state.name = 'banati'; //will not work

    the object can contain subset or superset of actual state
