It is middleware that helps us call APIS asynchronously from redux(action creators)

It only makes one small modification to our rules of action creators
Now, we can also either return object or functions from action creators

    import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
    import listManager from './reducers';
    import thunk from 'redux-thunk';

    let store = createStore(listManager, applyMiddleware(thunk));


    const creator = () => {
        return async function(dispatch, getState) {
            //dispatch and getState params are passed automatically when this
            //action creator is called

            const res = await fetch(url);
            dispatch({
                type: 'ADD',
                payload: res
            });
        }
    };
