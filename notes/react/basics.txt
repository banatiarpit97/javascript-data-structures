updating a parent component re renders all its children because parent needs to
pass the updated props(Even of the props does not change, children will still re render)
i.e. why we use redux and connect the components to store rather than to each other

Keep the static content in different component from dynamic content because if they are
in same component then static content will be rendered unnecessarily
