1. function example(){
    var name = "arpit";         //local variable

    number = 9999999999;        //will not create global variable   
                                //reference error
}

2. eval created whole new scope instead of changing the global scope.

3. 'with' keyword/scope is not allowed.

4. Default value of 'this' is undefined.

5. No hoisting is done, variables and functions need to be defined before they are used
