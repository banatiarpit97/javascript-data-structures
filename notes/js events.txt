adding events to elements :
    1. elem.addEventListener("event", func_name);   //no brackets after func_name
    2. elem.event = func_name;
    3. <button onlcick = "func_name()">

instead of func_name, we can define complete anonymous function or arrow function
Advantage of using 1st instead of 2nd, is that if we define 2 listeners for same event using 1st, then 
listener for that event is combined of all but in case 2nd latest listener overrides previous ones
3rd should not be used as we should not include js in html

removing events :
    elem.removeEventListener("event", func_name);

Event object :
elem.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
    console.log(e)          //event object
    e.preventDefault();     //prevent default behavious like submitting a form, redirect using a link
    e.stopPropogation();       //stop event bubbling
    //bubbling is set to true by default which means, that an event looks for listener in parent elements
        also
})
addEventListener can be called from a elem/selector that return a single elem
can be applied on .querySelector and .getElelemntById
can NOT be applied on .querySelectorAll and getElementsByClassName and getElementsByTagName

all selector functions are properties of document. i.e. document.getElementById...

to get the point(coords) of clicked poistion:
	document.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => {
		console.log(e.clientX, e.clientY);
	})

to get key pressed on keyboard:
	document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
		console.log(e.key)	//returns letter pressed like a,b,c,Alt,Control,Shift,ArrowUp,ArrowLeft
	})
