keys should be in double quotes(only strings allowed)

values :
strings -> double quotes
boolean, integer, array, objects -> no quotes

JSON.stringify(arr/object) -> converts json to strings so that it can be trasferred 
JSON.parse(json) -> converts string to json so that we can use it like a normal object like obj.prop

The second argument of JSON.stringify is the replacer. The replacer can either be a
function or an array, and lets you control what and how the values should be stringified.

If the replacer is an array, only the property names included in the array will be
added to the JSON string..

If the replacer is a function, this function gets called on every property in the
object you're stringifying. The value returned from this function will be the value
of the property when it's added to the JSON string. If the value is undefined, this
property is excluded from the JSON string.
