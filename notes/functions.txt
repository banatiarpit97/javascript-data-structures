function declaration :

    function name(){ }
    we can nest functions inside function:
        function name(){
            function class(){ }
        }
    

function expression :
    var name = function(){ }
    var name = function hi(){ }  //can give name to functions but it is of no use
                                 //still can not call function using 'hi', have to call using 'name' only

arrow function :
    var name = () => { }

IIFE:
    (function(){       //These are functions that are called immediately but can not be called again

    })();
    
    (function(a,b){    //passing arguements to iife

    })('a', 'b');

Using new :
    var name = new Function("console.log('hh)");
    name();

1. funtion expressions and arrow functions are not hoisted unlike declaration

2. function declaration can become function expression if declaration
is neither top level nor inside other functions.
    if(a>5){
        function name() { }   -> will be treated as expression
    }

    function name(){
        function class(){ }   -> will be treated as declaration
    }

3. Every function has an object called 'arguements' which is like an array of parameters passed.

4. Spread operator :
        extra arguements can be accomodated by spread operator(needs to be last parameter)
        function spread(a, b, ...c){
            console.log(c);     //will print an array -> [3,4,5,6];
        }
        spread(1,2,3,4,5,6);
