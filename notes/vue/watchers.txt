A watcher is a special Vue.js feature that allows you to spy on one property 
of the component state, and run a function when that property value changes.

<script>
    export default {
        data() {
            return {
                name: 'Flavio'
            }
        },
        watch: {
            name: function() {
                console.log(this.name)
            }
        }
    }
</script>

The function assigned to watch.name can optionally accept 2 parameters. 
The first is the new property value. The second is the old property value:

<script>
    export default {
        watch: {
            name: function(newValue, oldValue) {
                console.log(newValue, oldValue)
            }
        }
    }
</script>

Watchers cannot be looked up from a template as you can with computed properties.
