Any HTML is a valid Vue.js template. In addition to that, Vue.js provides 
two powerful things: interpolation and directives.

new Vue({
  data: {
    name: 'Flavio'
  },
  template: '<span>Hello {{name}}!</span>'
})

One interesting thing here. See how we just used name instead of this.data.name?
This is because Vue.js does some internal binding and lets the template use 
the property as if it was local. Pretty handy.

You can use any JavaScript expression inside your interpolations, 
but you’re limited to just one expression

The value included in any interpolation will be updated upon a change of any 
of the data properties it relies on.

You can avoid this reactivity by using the v-once directive.

The result is always escaped, so you can’t have HTML in the output.

If you need to have an HTML snippet, you need to use the v-html directive instead.
