Using Svelte you can create a two-way binding between data and the UI.

we could add an on:input event handler that sets the value of name to event.target.value, 
but it's a bit... boilerplatey, hence the bindings.

use let/var for bindings and not const, since value of const can not be changed
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
bind:value:
    if js variables changes, value of input will also change and if value of input
    changes, value of js variable will also be same
    <script>
        let name = ''
    </script>
    <input bind:value={name}>

    /////////////////
    bind:value also works for the select form field to get the selected value automatically
    assigned to the value of a variable:
    <script>
        let selected
    </script>
        <select bind:value={selected}>
            <option value="1">1</option>
            <option value="2">2</option>
            <option value="3">3</option>
        </select>

    Because we haven't set an initial value of selected, the binding will set it to the 
    default value (the first in the list) automatically. Be careful though — until the 
    binding is initialised, selected remains undefined, so we can't blindly reference 
    e.g. selected.id in the template.

    ///////////////////////////////
    In the DOM, everything is a string. That's unhelpful when you're dealing with 
    numeric inputs — type="number" and type="range" — as it means you have to 
    remember to coerce input.value before using it.
    With bind:value, Svelte takes care of it for you that means if we bind value of number
    type input, svelte will automatically convert the variable to number.

    bind:value works for textarea the same way it works for input

bind:checked:
    <script>
        let isChecked   //boolean
    </script>
    <input type=checkbox bind:checked={isChecked}>

bind:group:
    bind:group is handy with checkboxes and radio inputs, because those are very often used in
    groups. Using bind:group you can associate a JavaScript array to a list of checkboxes, and
    have it populated based on the choices made by the user
        <script>
            let goodDogs = []
            let dogs = ['Roger', 'Syd']
        </script>

        <ul>
            {#each dogs as dog}
                <li>{dog} <input type=checkbox bind:group={goodDogs} value={dog}></li>
            {/each}
        </ul>

bind:indeterminate:
    bind:indeterminate allows us to bind to the indeterminate state of an element (if you want to
    learn more head to https://css-tricks.com/indeterminate-checkboxes/)

Other bindings
    Depending on the HTML tag you are working on, you can apply different kinds of bindings.
    bind:files is a binding valid on type="file" input elements, to bind the list of selected files.
    The details HTML element allows the use of bind:open to bind its open/close value.
    The audio and video media HTML tags allow to bind several of their properties:
    currentTime , duration , paused , buffered , seekable , played , volume , playbackRate .
    textContent and innerHTML can be bound on contenteditable fields

Read-only bindings
    offsetWidth , offsetHeight , clientWidth , clientHeight can be bound, read only, on any
    block level HTML element, excluding void tags (like br ) and elements that are set to be inline
    ( display: inline ).

    clientWidth and clientHeight are measured by introducing an iframe inside that elem and
    then listening to window event of iframe. So use this sparingly as iframes are costly

bind:this :
    like ref in react
    allows you to get a reference to an HTML element and bind it to a JavaScript variable
        <script>
            let myInputField
        </script>
        <input bind:this={myInputField} />

    Note that the value of the variable 'myInputField' will be undefined until the 
    component has mounted, so we put the logic inside the onMount

binding to component props: (imp)
    To sync values between parent and child component
    using normal prop system, if parent value changes, then the updated value reaches the child
    but if child chnges the prop value, there is no way for parent to know that. Using prop binding
    we can achieve that.
    Using bind: in front of the prop, you can bind a value to any prop that a component exposes.

        <script>
            export let inMovement = false
        </script>
        <button on:click={() => inMovement = true }>Start car</button>

        <script>
            import Car from './Car.svelte';
            let carInMovement;
        </script>
        <Car bind:inMovement={carInMovement} />

    Use component bindings sparingly. It can be difficult to track the flow of data around 
    your application if you have too many of them, especially if there is no 'single source 
    of truth'.

shorthand for bind(variable name should be same as attribute to be bound):
    bind:value={value} can be replaced by bind:value
