Compared to React, Vue, Angular and other frameworks, an app built using Svelte is
compiled beforehand so you don't have to serve the whole framework to every one of your
site visitors. As a result, the fruition of the experience is smoother, consumes less bandwidth,
and everything feels faster and more lightweight.
At deployment, Svelte disappears and all you get is plain (and fast!) JavaScript.

Svelte is also faster at DOM manupilations because it does not use techniques like Virtual DOM,
it knows exactly which element to update when.

Also some common problems like state management, transitions, scoped css etc are built in the
framework itself, it probably easy to build these since svelte is just a compiler, it knows
how to parse
