@html
    strings are inserted as plain text, meaning that characters like < and > 
    have no special meaning.
    if we need to render HTML directly into a component, we can use @html tag:
        <p>{@html string}</p>

    Svelte doesn't perform any sanitization of the expression inside {@html ...} 
    before it gets inserted into the DOM. In other words, if you use this feature 
    it's critical that you manually escape HTML that comes from sources you don't 
    trust, otherwise you risk exposing your users to XSS attacks

{@debug ...} tag 
    use with a comma-separated list of values you want to inspect:
        {@debug user}
