    import { flip } from 'svelte/animate';

    <label animate:flip>

    we can also provide duration as parameter:
        <label animate:flip={{duration: 200}}>

        duration can also be a d => milliseconds function, where d is the number of 
        pixels the element has to travel

Note that all the transitions and animations are being applied with CSS, 
rather than JavaScript, meaning they won't block (or be blocked by) the main thread.
