Just like useEffect in react

If we want something to happen, when a particular state variable changes, then we use '$:'
    <script>
        let count = 0
        const incrementCount = () => {
            count = count + 1
        }
        $: console.log(`${count}`)
    </script>

    this can be a block of statements also:
        $: {
            console.log(`the count is ${count}`)
            console.log(`double the count is ${count * 2}`)
        }

    we can multiple '$:' in our component, and we can use them to fire functions, update other
    variables etc
