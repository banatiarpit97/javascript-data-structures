onMount -> fired after the component is rendered
        -> used to fetch data from api

onDestroy -> fired after the component is destroyed
          -> clean up data or stop timers

beforeUpdate -> fired before the DOM is updated
afterUpdate -> fired after the DOM is updated

We don't have access to any of those methods by default, but we need to import them from
the svelte package:
    <script>
        import { onMount, onDestroy, beforeUpdate, afterUpdate } from 'svelte'
    </script>

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
we can pass async functions inside these lifecycle events:
    onMount(async () => {
        //do something on mount
    })

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
if we return a function from onMount, it works as onDestroy
    onMount(async () => {
        //do something on mount
        return () => {
            //do something on destroy
        }
    })
