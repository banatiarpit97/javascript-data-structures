container properties:
    scroll-snap-type
    scroll-padding
        By default, content will snap to the very edges of the container. You can change that
        by setting the scroll-padding property on the container. It follows the same
        syntax as the regular padding property.

child properties:
    scroll-snap-align

When container element is scrolled, it will snap to the child elements

<div class="container">
    <section class="child"></section>
    <section class="child"></section>
    <section class="child"></section>
</div>

.container {
    scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;  //mandatory or proximity
    //vertical list, for horizontal, use x mandatory
}
.child {
    scroll-snap-align: start;   //start, center, end
}
