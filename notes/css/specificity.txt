SPECIFICITY
The more specific rule will win. If two or more rules have the same specificity, 
the one that appears last wins.

We have 4 slots, and each one of them starts at 0: 0 0 0 0 0. 
The slot at the left is the most important, and the rightmost one is the least important.

Slot 1
The first slot, the rightmost one, is the least important.
We increase this value when we have an element selector. An element is a tag name. 
If you have more than one element selector in the rule, you increment accordingly the value.
    p {}                    /* 0 0 0 1 */
    p span {}               /* 0 0 0 2 */
    div p > span {}         /* 0 0 0 3 */

Slot 2
The second slot is incremented by 3 things:
class selectors
pseudo-class selectors
attribute selectors
    .name {}                 /* 0 0 1 0 */
    .users .name {}          /* 0 0 2 0 */
    a[href$='.pdf'] {}       /* 0 0 1 1 */
    :hover {}                /* 0 0 1 0 */

One nice trick with classes is that you can repeat the same class and increase the specificity.
    .name {}              /* 0 0 1 0 */
    .name.name {}         /* 0 0 2 0 */
    .name.name.name {}    /* 0 0 3 0 */

Slot 3
The second slot is incremented by: the id.
    #name {}                    /* 0 1 0 0 */
    .user #name {}              /* 0 1 1 0 */
    #name span {}               /* 0 1 0 1 */

Slot 4
Slot 4 is affected by inline styles. Any inline style will have precedence over any rule 
defined in an external CSS file, or inside the style tag in the page header.
    <p style="color: red">Test</p> /* 1 0 0 0 */

Importance
Specificity does not matter if a rule ends with !important:
    p {
    font-size: 20px!important;
    }
Adding !important in a CSS rule is going to make that rule more important than any other rule, 
according to the specificity rules. The only way another rule can take precedence is to have 
!important as well, and have higher specificity in the other less important slots.

Tips
In general you should use the amount of specificity you need, but not more.

!important is a highly debated tool that CSS offers us. Many CSS experts advocate against using it.
But generally, !important should have no place in your CSS files.

Using the id attribute to style CSS is also debated a lot, since it has a 
very high specificity. A good alternative is to use classes instead, which have 
less specificity, and so they are easier to work with, and they are more powerful 
(you can have multiple classes for an element, and a class can be reused multiple times).
