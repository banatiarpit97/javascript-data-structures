The display property of an object determines how it is rendered by the browser.

All the HTML tags are displayed inline out of the box except some elements like 
div, p, ul and section, which are set as block by the user agent (the browser).

Inline:
Inline elements donâ€™t have any margin or padding applied.
Same for height and width.

inline-block
Similar to inline, but with inline-block width and height applied as you specify.
Also, with display: inline-block, the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected,
but with display: inline they are not.
Compared to display: block, the major difference is that display: inline-block does not add a 
line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements.

block
With display: block, elements are stacked one after each other, vertically, and every 
element takes up 100% of the page.

none
Using display: none makes an element disappear. It's still there in the HTML, 
but just not visible in the browser
