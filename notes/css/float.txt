The float property supports 3 values:
    left
    right
    none (the default)

A floated element is removed from the normal flow of the page, and the other 
content flows around it.


Clearing
    left to clear left floats
    right to clear right floats
    both to clear both left and right floats
    none (default) disables clearing
