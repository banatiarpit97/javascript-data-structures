Every CSS element is essentially a box. Every element is a generic box.
The box model explains the sizing of the elements based on a few CSS properties.

From the inside to the outside, we have:
    the content area
    padding
    border
    margin
/////////////////////////////////////////////////
BORDER
The border is a thin layer between padding and margin. By editing the border, you can 
make elements draw their perimeter on screen.

You can work on borders by using those properties:
    border-width
        thin, medium(Default), thick, px, em, rem
        You can set the width of each edge (Top-Right-Bottom-Left) separately by using 4 values:
        or you can use the specific edge properties border-top-width, border-right-width, 
        border-bottom-width, border-left-width.

    border-style
        dotted, dashed, slod, double, grove, inset, outset, none(default), hidden
        You can set a different style for each edge using the properties
        border-top-style, border-right-style, border-bottom-style, border-left-style

    border-color
        If you donâ€™t set a color, the border by default is colored using the color of the 
        text in the element.
        You can set the color of each edge (Top-Right-Bottom-Left) separately by using 4 values:
        or you can use the specific edge properties border-top-color, border-right-color, 
        border-bottom-color, border-left-color.

The property border can be used as a shorthand for all those properties.
    border: border-width, border-style and border-color;

border-radius is used to create rounded corners.
    You can also use the edge-specific properties border-top-left-radius, border-top-right-radius, 
    border-bottom-left-radius, border-bottom-right-radius.

You also have the ability to use images as borders, an ability given to you by border-image 
and its specific separate properties:
    border-image-source
    border-image-slice
    border-image-width
    border-image-outset
    border-image-repeat
    and the shorthand border-image.
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
PADDING
The padding CSS property is commonly used in CSS to add space in the inner side of an element.

margin adds space outside an element border
padding adds space inside an element border

padding has 4 related properties that alter the padding of a single edge at once:
    padding-top
    padding-right
    padding-bottom
    padding-left

padding is a shorthand to specify multiple padding values at the same time, and depending 
on the number of values entered, it behaves differently.
    Using a single value applies that to all the paddings: top, right, bottom, left.
    Using 2 values applies the first to bottom & top, and the second to left & right.
    Using 3 values applies the first to top, the second to left & right, the third to bottom.
    Using 4 values applies the first to top, the second to right, the third to bottom, the 
    fourth to left.
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

MARGIN
margin has 4 related properties that alter the margin of a single edge at once:
    margin-top
    margin-right
    margin-bottom
    margin-left

    same rules as padding for shorthand property

Using a negative margin
margin is the only property related to sizing that can have a negative value. 
It's extremely useful, too. Setting a negative top margin makes an element move over 
elements before it, and given enough negative value it will move out of the page.

A negative bottom margin moves up the elements after it.
A negative right margin makes the content of the element expand beyond its allowed content size.
A negative left margin moves the element left over the elements that precede it, and given 
enough negative value it will move out of the page.

Top and bottom marginsof blocks collapse into single margin(whose size is the largest)
This is called as margin collapsing.
This does not happen with elements that are floated or have position: absolute
