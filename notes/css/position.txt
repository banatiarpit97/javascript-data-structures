Positioning is what makes us determine where elements appear on the screen, 
and how they appear.

Static positioning
This is the default value for an element. Static positioned elements are displayed in 
the normal page flow.

Relative positioning
If you set position: relative on an element, you are now able to position it with an 
offset, using the properties top, left, bottom, right
in relative positioning, the space originally occupied by an element was preserved 
even if it was moved around

Absolute positioning
Setting position: absolute on an element will remove it from the document's flow.
We can now move the box around as we please, using the top, right, bottom, left properties
The coordinates are relative to the closest container that is not static.

Fixed positioning
Like with absolute positioning, when an element is assigned position: fixed it's removed 
from the flow of the page.
The difference with absolute positioning is this: elements are now always positioned 
relative to the window, instead of the first non-static container.
Another big difference is that elements are not affected by scrolling. Once you put a 
sticky element somewhere, scrolling the page does not remove it from the visible part of the page
