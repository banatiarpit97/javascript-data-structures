Itâ€™s very useful when you have multiple elements that overlap each other, and you 
need to decide which one is visible, as nearer to the user, and which one(s) 
should be hidden behind it.

This property takes a number (without decimals) (Negative numbers too)and uses that 
number to calculate which elements appear nearer to the user, in the Z axis.

The higher the z-index value, the more an element is positioned nearer to the user.

The default value is auto, a special keyword. Using auto, the Z axis order is 
determined by the position of the HTML element in the page - the last sibling 
appears first, as it's defined last.

By default elements have the static value for the position property. 
In this case, the z-index property does not make any difference - it must be set 
to absolute, relative or fixed to work.
