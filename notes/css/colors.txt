We have these properties:
    color
    background-color
    border-color

color value:
    Named colors
        like blue, black plus tranparent, and currentColor

    RGB and RGBa
        rgb(255, 255, 255)  //value can be between 0 and 255
        rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);     //4th value is alpha i.e. traansparency/opacity

    Hexadecimal notation
        #000000 or #000
        The hexadecimal notation lets us express a number from 0 to 255 in just 2 digits, 
        since they can go from 0 to “15” (f).
        We can add the alpha channel by adding 1 or 2 more digits at the end, 
        for example #00000033.
        Not all browsers support the shortened notation, so use all 6 digits 
        to express the RGB part.

    HSL and HSLa(Hue Saturation Lightness)
        In this notation, black is hsl(0, 0%, 0%) and white is hsl(0, 0%, 100%).
        You also have hsla() which adds the alpha channel to the mix, again a number 
        from 0 to 1: hsl(0, 0%, 0%, 0.5)

    prefer hsl over rgb when interpolating values
