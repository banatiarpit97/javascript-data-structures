Pixels
A pixel does not actually correlate to a physical pixel on your screen, 
as that varies, a lot, by device (think high-DPI devices vs non-retina devices).

Percentages
let you specify values in percentages of that parent elementâ€™s corresponding property.

Real-world measurement units
    cm a centimeter (maps to 37.8 pixels)
    mm a millimeter (0.1cm)
    q a quarter of a millimeter
    in an inch (maps to 96 pixels)
    pt a point (1 inch = 72 points)
    pc a pica (1 pica = 12 points)

Relative units
    em is the value assigned to that element's font-size, therefore its exact value 
    changes between elements. It does not change depending on the font used, just on the 
    font size. In typography this measures the width of the m letter.

    rem is similar to em, but instead of varying on the current element font size, it 
    uses the root element (html) font size. You set that font size once, and rem will 
    be a consistent measure across all the page.

    ex is like em, but inserted of measuring the width of m, it measures the height of 
    the x letter. It can change depending on the font used, and on the font size.

    ch is like ex but instead of measuring the height of x it measures the width of 0 (zero).

Viewport units
    vw the viewport width unit represents a percentage of the viewport width. 
        50vw means 50% of the viewport width.
    vh the viewport height unit represents a percentage of the viewport height. 
        50vh means 50% of the viewport height.
    vmin the viewport minimum unit represents the minimum between the height 
    or width in terms of percentage. 
        30vmin is the 30% of the current width or height, depending which one is smaller
    vmax the viewport maximum unit represents the maximum between the height 
    or width in terms of percentage. 
        30vmax is the 30% of the current width or height, depending which one is bigger

Fraction units
    fr are fraction units, and they are used in CSS Grid to divide space into fractions.
