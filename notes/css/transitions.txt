CSS Transitions are the simplest way to create an animation in CSS.

In a transition, you change the value of a property, and you tell CSS to 
slowly change it according to some parameters, towards a final state.

transition-property
    the css property that should transition

transition-duration
    duration of transition

transition-timing-function
    timing function used by animation i.e. linear, ease(Default), ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out

transition-delay
    number of seconds to wait before starting the animation(optional)

transition: property
              duration
              timing-function
              delay;

    .one,
    .three {
    background: rgba(142, 92, 205, .75);
    transition: background 1s ease-in;
    }
