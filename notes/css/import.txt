From any CSS file you can import another CSS file using the @import directive.
    @import url(myfile.css)

url() can manage absolute or relative URLs.

@import directives must be put before any other CSS in the file, or they will be ignored.

You can use media descriptors to only load a CSS file on the specific media:
    @import url(myfile.css) all;
    @import url(myfile-screen.css) screen;
    @import url(myfile-print.css) print;
    

Paths in url(for import and background etc)
    relative
        url(../test.png);
    Absolute
        url(/test.png)
        url(https://mysite.com/test.png)
