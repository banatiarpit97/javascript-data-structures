The format is the /* this is a comment */

This is a multiline comment. Until you add the closing */ token, 
the all the lines found after the opening one are commented.

CSS does not have inline comments, like // in C or JavaScript.

Pay attention though — if you add // before a rule, the rule will not be applied, 
looking like the comment worked. In reality, CSS detected a syntax error and due to 
how it works it ignored the line with the error, and went straight to the next line.
