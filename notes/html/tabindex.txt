Any tabindex greater than 0 jumps the element to the front of the natural tab order.
If there are multiple elements with a tabindex greater than 0, tab order starts
from lowest valute that is grater than 0 and works its way up. Using a tabindex
greater than 0 is considered as anti pattern
setting tabindex lower than 0 will remove the element from tab flow.

tabindex="2"
